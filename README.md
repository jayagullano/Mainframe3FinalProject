# Mainframe POS System
This is the final project for Mainframe Development III.

The final mainframe project involves a POS system that communicated directly with a mainframe. This project was a conversational program that is similar to how banks operate, with online transaction processing capabilities, otherwise known as OLTP. The project began with the engine programs. These would exist in what we call datasets, similar to directories but they are found in the mainframe server. The datasets would include three kinds of programs, COBOL programs that contained the base code, JCL programs which would then compile these cobol programs, then BMS files which stands for basic mapping support. The project specifically would have storage files containing invoices of sales, customer information, and a product catalog. Therefore the application would allow you to register new users, you could create invoices for a client with detailed descriptions of the products, how much they cost, and your total upon completion. The program did have a reporting feature which would show you the total amount of revenue produced from the sales entry, and the total amount of invoices.
